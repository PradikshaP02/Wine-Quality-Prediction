Used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 6 or higher) or not (a score below 6). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol

The objectives of this project is:
To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy

The classification model includes:
Logistic Regression
SVM
KNN
Guassian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
