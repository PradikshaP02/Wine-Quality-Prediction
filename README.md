Used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 6 or higher) or not (a score below 6). 

The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

- Fixed acidity

- Volatile acidity

- Citric acid

- Residual sugar

- Chlorides

- Free sulfur dioxide

- Total sulfur dioxide

- Density

- pH

- Sulfates

- Alcohol

The objectives of this project is:

To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy

The classification model includes:

- Logistic Regression

- SVM

- KNN

- Guassian Naive Bayes

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest
